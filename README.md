## Experimental UI for ThingWorx Machine Learning

[ThingWorx Machine Learning](http://www.thingworx.com/machine-learning) is a Powerful advanced and predictive analytics engine for ThingWorx developers
Few know how to create, operationalize, and maintain advanced and predictive intelligence. That’s why we’ve built powerful machine learning technology inside the ThingWorx platform – to automate these complex processes.

ThingWorx Machine Learning enables developers to easily:
- Build solutions that include predictive analytics
- Scale advanced analytics to the largest of datasets
- Integrate proactive intelligence into any ThingWorx-powered solution

All without having to be an expert in data science or complex mathematics.
