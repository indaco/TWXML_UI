### Introduction
[ThingWorx Machine Learning](http://www.thingworx.com/machine-learning) is a Powerful advanced and predictive analytics engine for ThingWorx developers Few know how to create, operationalize, and maintain advanced and predictive intelligence. That's why we've built powerful machine learning technology inside the ThingWorx platform â€“ to automate these complex processes.

ThingWorx Machine Learning enables developers to easily:
- Build solutions that include predictive analytics
- Scale advanced analytics to the largest of datasets
- Integrate proactive intelligence into any ThingWorx-powered solution

All without having to be an expert in data science or complex mathematics.

### What this project is about?
The goal of this project is to provide an easy and fast tool to start any kind of project with ThingWorx Machine Learning as a standalone advanced analytic engine. Be focused on the job, learn more on ThingWorx Machine Learning doing your job and avoid wasted time.

So it lets you to:
- read the API documentation in order to understand what you need to start
- use Postman writing Javascript objects to call a REST APIs
- waste time to fixing the REST API body instead to be focused on what you are trying to achieve in terms of analytics
- look for a single and easy way to know the meaning of input parameters
- ...

#### Features
- HTML5 user interface built with ExpressJS, Bootstrap and JQuery
- Inline help for input fields
- _Live_ form validation
- Auto-detect analysis goals
- Easily creation of Filters and reuse them in other jobs
- Check jobs status with one click
- Retrieve jobs results with one click
- Glossary:
  - Add, update or delete entries editing the `app_server/public/glossary_dictionary.json` file

*Current version (v.0.2.0) doesn't fully cover TWXML APIs*: Postman or similar are still required if you want to do something like:
- Filters creations and usage
- Scoring
- Prescriptive job and results
- Predictive evaluation

Next version will include additional features. Remember that you can always add features and then share with the team :-)
